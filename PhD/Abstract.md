The abstract is related to some realization during my PhD period.
When you want to write more papers:

1. Review most papers in this filed before you want to do some new subjects.

2. Do not try to do big things, such as creat a new theory. Take action to modify some open source from some popular and stable projects.

3. Make sure what you want to do during the PhD period. Do not linger too long in conversations with others.

When embarking on a project and aiming to secure buy-in from stakeholders, it's crucial to follow these steps:

1. Clear Demand Articulation:
```
Dedicate effort to clearly articulating the demand, outlining the problem statement, objectives, and expected outcomes. Ensure that all stakeholders understand the purpose and benefits of the project.
```
2. Breakdown into Feasible Realizations:
```
Divide the project into smaller, manageable components or phases. Each component should be feasible to implement within a reasonable timeframe and resource allocation. This breakdown enables better control, monitoring, and progress tracking.
```
3. Organize Realizations:
```
Arrange the realizations logically, considering dependencies and sequencing. Prioritize based on urgency, impact, and resource availability. Establish clear milestones and deliverables for each realization to ensure progress is measurable and visible.
```
4. Optimize and Iterate:
```
Continuously optimize the project plan by identifying opportunities for improvement, resource allocation, or risk mitigation. Encourage feedback from stakeholders and team members to address any issues or challenges promptly. Iterate on the project plan as needed to adapt to changing circumstances or new insights.
```
